program that simulate the CPU Scheduling process for 1000
process, the project should simulates the following algorithms:
1- First Come First Served scheduling algorithm (FCFS)
2- Shortest Job Frist scheduling algorithm (SJF)
3- Priority scheduling algorithm
4- Round Robin Scheduling algorithm (RR) with time quantum equals
1 ms
